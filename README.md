# Overview
Human-in-the-Loop AI Supervisor
This project implements a modular, self-improving AI system designed to intelligently escalate customer queries that the AI agent cannot answer. The system then captures the human supervisor's answer, uses it to follow up with the original customer via SMS, and permanently updates its knowledge base.

This system is built on a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), split into two decoupled Node.js applications and one MongoDB database.
